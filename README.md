# Game-Escape
A game made with Java Swing in which a user plays 4 minigames against a clock.

This game was created in 2022 and is my first project with Java Swing. Some buttons/text may not load and requires the mouse
to run over the element to appear. Launch the application and click on the start button on the right to start the clock!
